Contact forms can be used to collect any type of data or to let your user send you a message without exposing directly the email of your business!

> To declare a contact form, set as **Form Name** the value **Contact**.

By default the contact form will be stored in your database into a custom post type called **Contact Forms**:

![](/images/contact-forms-wp.png)

and will be sent by email on the address you specify into the Contact forms settings. (By default it will be the admin email).

You can change what happens when a form is sent by following the path: **Contact Forms > Settings**:

![](/images/contact-forms-settings.png)

You can choose between:

1. Send email and save into database;
2. Send only email;
3. Save only into database;
